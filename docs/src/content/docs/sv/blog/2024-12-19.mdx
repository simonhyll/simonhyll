I was going to write a blog post about this, but then life got in the way.

Look it up. Long story short, enable RCS for your text messages and it **might** make your chat E2E encrypted, you can see it in your messaging app if it is.

If you can't get your messages to be encrypted the recommendation is to stop using SMS altogether and instead opt for services that are E2E encrypted, which is basically any messaging service you can think of that isn't based on cellular technology, like WhatsApp. I personally haven't made any such switch, I've just enabled RCS and most of my chats are now E2E encrypted, and those that aren't I'm ok with accepting for now that they're not encrypted.

I do however strongly urge everyone right now to stop using SMS as a primary or secondary authentication method, switch to passkeys instead wherever possible. If all else fails then even email based authentication is a step up from SMS based right now.
