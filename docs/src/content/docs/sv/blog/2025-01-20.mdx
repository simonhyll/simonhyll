I want to apologise to all the people in the open source community that I have let down in the past 6-9 months. We've had 2 deaths in the family and it has demanded every single bit of my time to deal with. That however is no excuse for not dealing with things in a better manner, it's just that my standard response to these sorts of situations is to disengage and become unresponsive.

I'm going to try to do better, life is slowly getting more stable, hope I can actually work again on some of my projects, and most importantly, get back into the Tauri community in earnest!
