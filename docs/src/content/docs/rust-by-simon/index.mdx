## Why Rust?

Memory safety, type checking, easy tooling, dedicated community, great performance. Need I go on? Rust is the full package! Does that mean it's flawless? No, e.g. memory safety isn't quite as fool proof as some believe, the type checking and ownership systems can lead to lots of fighting against the compiler to write code that compiles so it's not very beginner friendly. But I love it!

## Other learning resources

What I'm compiling should be enough to take you from drab to crab, but there are a lot of other resources you might want to look at for information on Rust:

- [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/): This is an official resource and it's quite well made, albeit a bit dry and boring at times. I've read it in full and can definitely recommend any aspiring rustacean to do the same!
