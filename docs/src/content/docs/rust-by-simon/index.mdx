## Other learning resources

What I'm compiling should be enough to take you from drab to crab, but there are a lot of other resources you might want to look at for information on Rust:

- [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/): This is an official resource and it's quite well made, albeit a bit dry and boring at times. I've read it in full and can definitely recommend any aspiring rustacean to do the same!
