My personal projects are released under the `simonhyll-` prefix on [crates.io](https://crates.io). Additionally I am planning on launching a simple cargo index for my own crates so you can get added guarantees that I am the one who developed the crate, to effectively act as a form of namespace. All my crates will be available both on [crates.io](https://crates.io) and on my own registry.

:::caution
There is no guarantee on [crates.io](https://crates.io) that just because you find a crate that uses the `simonhyll-` prefix that it's actually officially released by me. This is a serious shortcoming in the Rust ecosystem but sadly there hasn't been much interest to implement a proper namespacing system yet from the maintainers themselves.

As a result, whenever you find a crate you want to use you have to manually validate ownership of the crate. For my projects this can be easily done by checking the mixture of the repository link and the owner user. If the user says `simonhyll` and the repository links to a `simonhyll` owner repository on GitHub it's definitely owned and maintained by me.
