  This is a SimonSays box, and in a world of people with a deficit of attention, I'll
  be the one to give you the TL;DR version of what you're reading.

  For instance, you can skip this page entirely, it's just some guy going on and on
  about himself.

## Who am I?

The name's **Simon Hyll**, don't wear it out. Or do, I'm not that picky. I'm still figuring out what I want to write here.

For now just know that I'm some guy from Sweden that enjoys programming and teaching.

## Support me

The most direct way of supporting me and my projects is by making donations. It gives me a form of direct feedback as to how much people actually appreciate my efforts.

- [GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/simonhyll)
- [Patreon](https://patreon.com/simonhyll)

If money isn't an option you can raise issues and make PR's for my projects, or just reach out to me and tell me you appreciate what I've done. Emotional support is also support!
