title: Procedures
description: Step by step guides without the fluff
summary: |
  The procedures outlined here are not aimed to give you a too deep look into the theory behind things, but rather step by step the exact order of operations to carry something out. They're more intended for those that already know the surrounding theory and just want checklists to follow, but they can also be used by those learning about them to see how they're actually carried out in practice.
