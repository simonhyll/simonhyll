## General

### Frontend framework

Tauri is divided into two sections, the frontend and the backend. The frontend is everything that runs within a webview served by Tauri and the backend is anything that happens directly in the underlying binary of your application.

Depending on which frontend framework you choose you'll need to set that up separately. Here's a list of some frameworks I recommend:

- JavaScript
  - Nuxt
  - Solid
  - Svelte
- Rust
  - Leptos
  - Sycamore

### Rust

Install rustup and the latest stable version of Rust. Tauri is Rust based so it's non-optional to have it installed.

Continue by jumping to platform specific instructions:

- [Windows](#windows)
- [Mac](#mac)
- [Linux](#linux)
